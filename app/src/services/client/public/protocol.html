      <h1>Protocol</h1>
      <hr>
      
      <p><a href="https://github.com/i5hi/cypherpost">cypherpost</a> is an end-to-end encrypted social network protocol to selectively share posts among peers.</p>
      <p>Its first application allows inviduals to post Bitcoin BUY/SELL advertisements in a private and pure peer-to-peer fashion.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <br/>
      <h3>Portable E2EE</h3>
      
      <p>Currently, all e2ee applications use RSA keys. While RSA keys have an extremely high degree of entropy, the problem with these keys are primarily the lack of portability and the need to maintain a master device to recover your account.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/i5hi/cypherpost">cypherpost</a> uses ECDSA keys and leverages the flexibility of the <b>BIP32</b> HD Key standard and simiplicity of <b>BIP39</b> mnemonic word master key; to achieve a more portable form of e2ee.</p>
      <p>In addition to e2ee, these keys are also used for authentication and signing the occurence of important actions - such as making a post or giving a badge.</p>
      
      <br/>

      <h3>Badges</h3>
      <p>Reputation and classification of users on <a href="https://github.com/i5hi/cypherpost">cypherpost</a> is achieved through issuance of badges. </p>
      <p>Giving someone a 'Trusted' badge, not only adds to their overall reputation but also specifically allows users to classify others into groups and more easily set visibility of their data.</p>
      <p>The value of a badge is subjective. If a user has 100 Trusted badges and only 10 of them are from users that you have given a badge to, then these 10 badges are more meaningful than the remaining 90.</p>
      <p>Cypherpost currently supports 3 badges: Trusted, Scammer & MetInPerson.</p>
      <br/>

      <h3>Muting Users</h3>
      <p>If many users have 'Trusted' you, you will have a lot of posts on your feed. You have the ability to 'Mute' users that are flooding your feed with unwanted and unproductive posts.</p>
      <br/>
<hr>
      <h2>Mechanism</h2>
      <br/>
      <h3>ECDSA Shared Secret</h3>
      <p>At the core of the e2ee model is the ECDSA shared secret.</p>
      <p>All users have a primary 'recipient' key pair comprised of a public key and private key.</p>
      <p>Given two users, Alice and Bob; both can compute the same shared secret with their private key and the other's public key.</p>
      <p>This shared secret is used to encrypt the key that is used to encrypt/decrypt cypher_json posts.</p>
      <p>If a user is trusting 10 other users, they only encrypt their data with a single key; and then, encrypt this key with a shared secret computed for each of their trusted users (creating 10 copies of encrypted keys) and share the encrypted key with each of them; which they can each use to decrypt on their end and use to view the cypherdata.</p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Revocation</h3>
      <p>When you stop trusting a user (revoke trust) you reencrypt your cypherdata with a new key and repeat the process of computing the shared secret and encrypting the key with the shared secret for all your remaining trusted users.</p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Bitcoin Keys</h3>
      <p>The BIP32 key derivation model is used to derive an infinite amount of child keys that are used to encrypt/decrypt all data flowing through cypherpost. This is done by deriving a new key from the user's master key which is derived from a BIP39 seed.</p>
      <p>We use the following path standard:  <span class="" >m/purpose'/service'/services'/index'/revoke'</span>; with 3 main services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identity: Used to authenticate and compute shared secrets</li>
        <li>Preferences: Used to store client side preferences</li>
        <li>Posts: Used to encrypt/decrypt your posts</li>
      </ul>
